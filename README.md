# Titch2000_Arena
A resource to add the arena from the new GTA Online update (Arena War) to FiveM

## Configuration
To change what map and scene you are using please just edit the two variables at the top of the arena_c.lua.

```
local map = 0 -- this is the map you want to use. 1-17 for dystopian and 1-10 for the others.
local scene = "" -- this is the scene you want to use the options are dystopian, scifi and wasteland
```

## Side note
There are many other options and props that can be added to the map for example fences and turrets. I might add these at a later date or someone can submit a pr that is also fine!

### Thanks
